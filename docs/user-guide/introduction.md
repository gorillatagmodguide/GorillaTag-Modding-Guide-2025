You can:
- Customize your gorilla with custom materials, infected materials, hats, and holdables with [***Custom Cosmetics***](https://github.com/wryser/CustomCosmetics)
- Use custom shirts, badges and more with [***Gorilla Shirts***](https://github.com/developer9998/GorillaShirts)
- Get a variety of mods all with the press of a button with [***GorillaWatch***](https://github.com/ArtificialGorillas/GorillaWatch)
- Change the background of the gorilla computer with [***Computer Backgrounds***](https://github.com/Striker-67/computer-backgrounds)
- Mess around with other gorillas! [***Grate***](https://github.com/The-Graze/Grate)

There are *many more mods* to discover, and you'll find them in the **PC-Mod-Releases** category on the [GorillaTag Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/b2MhDBAzTv).

### Is modding the game safe?

Modding the game is allowed by the developers of Gorilla Tag, however keep in mind the following:

!> The use of mods that interfere with gameplay inside public lobbies is forbidden by the developers and can result in a ban. Please keep mods contained to private lobbies. **Most gameplay-changing mods automatically disable joining public lobbies, but please be careful.**

### End Goal

This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Gorilla Tag installation from vanilla to modded with BepInEx.
